			OpenNMS is written almost entirely in Java, and should be able to run on any system that supports the Sun Java Virtual Machine -- OpenNMS 1.3.x and higher requires Java 5 or higher.  There are requirements for other programs such as PostgreSQL and Perl, but the JDK is the key requirement as most of the other packages can be compiled from source.

					<para>
						Note that while it is technically possible to install on FAT32, NTFS is the only officially supported filesystem for Windows installs. Additionally, while Windows is supported, OpenNMS is much more heavily	tested (and easier to maintain) on UNIX, and it is recommended that unless you have a specific reason to go with Windows, that you use	one of the supported UNIX-based operating systems.

				OpenNMS 1.3.7 and up require Java 5 (a 1.5 JDK) and PostgreSQL 7.4 or higher. In addition, for native RRD support (as opposed to the builtin Java-based JRobin round-robin database), RRDTool 1.2 is required.
			</para>

	    <para>
				Any operating system that can support these dependencies should be able to run OpenNMS. However, since many older distributions do not support packages for these applications it will be much harder to get them installed, and so they are not officially supported.
			</para>

	    <para>
				A number of distributions that used to be supported are still able to run OpenNMS but are not officially supported.
